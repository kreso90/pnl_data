        1. Whose wallets are the wallets in the Top 10 best wallets to track or
        copy-trade tab, and why did you select those?
      </p>
      <p>
        We look for wallets on BullX Neo that generated a good profit with well
        performing projects that day. We click on multiple wallets and it will
        show the win and lose percentages. If they generated a stable win
        percentage, with a reasonable entry price, we continue to investigate
        and monitor that wallet on Solscan.io to see what the age of that wallet
        is, and or any transactions that might possibly appear as a red flag.
        Per example, if that wallet has many, if not all transactions have a
        duration of holding time per project invested of mere seconds, then
        either there is a possibility that the holder of said wallet is either a
        bot, or a trader that is aware they are being copy-traded and they sell
        immediately on their copy-traders. That would be a reason for us not to
        share that wallet on our platform, because of the risk to our users.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        2. If a wallet is good enough to copy-trade, why do you change them
        daily?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the risk involved explained in the first question. People who
        are very profitable are mostly the people who are knowledgeable with
        on-chain data analysis. They will quickly understand they are being
        copy-traded and they will change their trading strategy accordingly. So
        the safest way to copy-trade a wallet, is to do it as shortly as
        possible and move on before that person starts selling on his/her
        copy-traders and your projected winnings turn into projected losses.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>3. What does KOL mean?</p>
      <p>
        Key Opinion Leader. An influencer that impacts the price and popularity
        of a project by simply posting or talking about said project. Positively
        and negatively.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>4. Why do you show KOL wallets on your platform?</p>
      <p>
        KOL’s have a great impact on the marketcap of a token, and tracking or
        copy-trading them could be financially rewarding. It enables you to get
        into a project before they announce their participation on social media.
        However, the risk involved is usually higher than copying an unknown
        well performing trader.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>5. Can anyone submit their PnL cards for a Daily Best slot?</p>
      <p>
        Yes they can. However, if you want to have it displayed with your X
        account, wallet address and other statistics, there is a fee of 0.65
        Sol. This is not only because we will check the credentials of that
        wallet, we will check the previous 20 transactions as well and calculate
        the profitability of the wallet and display it on our platform. It is
        also financially and personally interesting for the wallet holder
        because of the possibility of new followers and copy-traders, which in
        turn can generate you more impact, influence and with that financial
        benefits. Every submitted PnL card will be checked on the blockchain if
        correct.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        6. Are the Best X Accounts to follow added randomly or is it a paid
        feature?
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not a paid feature and it’s also not random. There are many good X
        accounts out there to follow and we shall display as many of them as
        possible on our platform. However, we do not display X accounts of
        people who are known for misleading their followers, no matter how
        influential they are. You can also submit X accounts you would like us
        to show on our website, and we will carefully check if they are worthy
        to be added. If they are, we shall display them as soon as there is a
        slot available.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        7. Can anyone request their Private Alpha Group to be displayed under
        the Top Private tab?
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone can, the price for having your group added on our website is 2
        Sol for 5 days of displaying, but we will check all statistics related
        to that group. If it doesn’t meet our standards we will not display it
        even if you pay triple. If your group does get accepted we shall
        actively advertise your Private Alpha Group on our Twitter channel and
        in our Telegram account as well.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        8. Are the contract addresses for the Top 20 MC projects all Solana
        addresses?
      </p>
      <p>
        No they are not, a lot of them are, but there are a few such as Doge,
        Shib and Brett are not.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        9. How sure is investing in projects displayed on the
        Upcoming/Challenges tab?
      </p>
      <p>
        All investing has a certain risk. We try to mitigate that risk by
        carefully checking the credentials of the developer or person that is
        doing the challenge. If we feel something is off we simply do not accept
        their submission. However, this doesn’t guarantee a positive outcome of
        a token.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        10. What does it cost to have my project or challenge added to the
        Upcoming/Challenge tab?
      </p>
      <p>
        The price is 2 Sol for 5 days of displaying, but we will check all
        statistics related to that project or trader. If it doesn’t meet our
        standards we will not display that project or challenge even if you pay
        triple. If your project or challenge does get accepted we shall actively
        advertise your project or challenge on our Twitter channel and in our
        Telegram account as well.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>11. What does Futures trading mean?</p>
      <p>
        Futures trading is trading with leverage. Depending on the accepted
        leverage by the platform you’re trading on, you can either predict the
        price of a token is going up or down. We recommend Ox.fun and
        Hyperliquid to trade memecoin futures.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        12. Are those the best Youtube channels to follow which you display on
        your Top YouTube Channels tab?
      </p>
      <p>
        We display a variety of YouTube channels on our website. Some do live
        trading, some purely give information. We try to display the ones who
        give the most information, most honest information, tutorials and
        anything else to people who genuinely help the memecoin trading space,
        and make it safer and easier for you to trade.

export const RoadmapContent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Roadmap</h1>
      <p>
        We’ve tried to create something special that would hold the value of the
        project and token whether the developer sold or not. After long
        contemplation what would be the best strategy we came up with PnLdata
        and the specific way it is set up. PnLdata is a project that will either
        generate investors reasonable and large returns or minimise losses,
        which will add intrinsic value to our ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most projects’ incentive is to look good, not to be good. That’s where
        we differ, because it pays us to be good and transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do most projects fail? Because nothing new is ever added. There is
        no incentive for people to keep investing in the project. That is
        completely different with PnLdata, as new information and events are
        added daily to our platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to create a recurring revenue model to keep incentive and
        interest going.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being scammed before like many of you we’ve set up a simple security
        strategy. Many of you are aware of malware links, phishing links and
        basic persuasion scams. To secure ourselves from malicious links we
        simply never open any links forwarded to us by ‘potential new customers’
        who pretend to want to advertise on our platform, but their true goal is
        to either drain our wallets or alter information on our website so their
        wallets would be copied and they would reap the rewards from that. We
        will use a separate computer on a separate network with a vpn and a
        firewall before we open any links, if by then we haven’t detected
        malware by then of course. Also the computer which updates the website
        is completely separate from every other one we use for our daily tasks,
        as is each one used by us.
      </p>
      <p>
        People in this sphere have one thing on their minds and that thing is
        profits. So when there’s one website that gives them that information
        from all subcategories it’s logical they’ll have an intrinsic need to
        visit that website frequently and check and verify its data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve been in many telegram groups and the amount of uninformed people
        are staggering. And even when they are slightly informed, they don’t
        know all the aspects of memecoin trading and what to watch for.
      </p>
      <p>
        80% of traders either don’t know about trading bots or how to use them,
        or simply never used them. Yes, 80%! And more than 95% doesn’t know
        about memecoin futures trading. Aside from that, there are new traders
        coming onto the market daily, who we can direct towards successful
        trading influencers and non-famous traders, making them better known,
        making them even better trades, making them even better profits in the
        process, making us the go-to platform to work with and endorse.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s the combined effort of influencers, private groups, call channels
        and individual investors that will make this a valuable tool. We are not
        betting on one stream of information, investor or influencer to get this
        to an elevated position. Any great project involves a team and a
        community which this project has in abundance.
      </p>
      <p>Never trade alone!</p>
      <p>
        The idea, the setup and work-ethic will make this the project of the
        year, if not the decade.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a lot of different apps and aides on the internet and YouTube
        about trading, but they all have some things in common. They are either
        too complicated for most people, or they are too expensive for people to
        start with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, there are loads of apps that can make you select a plethora of
        filters and adjustments, but people want simplicity. And that’s what we
        are providing. What to buy, where to buy it, and some basic information,
        nothing more. More options and more functionality doesn’t necessarily
        make a better product.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you buy a car, not only do you not need a hardened race car with a
        thousand different setup options for every possible situation, but most
        don’t want it. But it’s great for the person that does want it. Most
        people want either no engine or suspension setup options or a maximum of
        3. That’s what we are providing with PnLdata.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will do weekly reviews of memecoin YouTube channels and if and when
        we are monetised, 50% of that revenue will also be reinvested in our
        token.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s all about identifying a problem, creating a solution, making sure
        we had enough funds in advance, create advertisements, launch and
        sustain or project.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are usually 3 types of launches. Either, all the hype, news and
        updates come before launch, or at launch, or after launch, We’ve decided
        to do all 3. Building trust and confidence to the moment up till launch
        by providing the users with most of the tools and information which we
        promised them, to show users and investors that we are willing to put in
        the hours and do what it takes to succeed with them. To expand at launch
        to all the promised functionality we’ve been discussing and advertising
        about up until launch. After launch, to keep on updating, growing, and
        adding functionalities to our website and other socials per request of
        our users.
